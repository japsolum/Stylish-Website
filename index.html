          The internet is basically a bunch of computers that communicate with eachother. They use browsers like chrome or Firefox to send command protocols to a server at another location in order to receive the web pages they are requesting. Those pages can include anything from pictures and movies to basic text, but all are comprised of html which is the language the computer reads so it knows what to display.

            Computers are very literal. They have no ability to interpret what it <b>thinks</b> you mean. But basically have to be told like a child exactly what to do, and how to do it. With this being said, it may be said that computers are stupid. I think it just means they don't let previous knowledge of a subject get in the way of doing what it is told. Which I think makes them smarter and better at learning than us. As long as you know how to communicate with them.

        <p class="text">
            The structure of a webpage is built using html. Html is the language computers use to determine what is displayed on a web page. It is comprised of a series of opening and (usually) closing tags that form together to create elements. Elements can also be thought of as the overall idea of what you are telling the computer to do. These elements can be broken down further into categories of inline or block. Block elements single themselves out by basically creating an  invisible box around the content that's inside.

        <h3 class="subheader">CSS</h3>
        <p class="text">
          CSS iss the style of a page. It can take the elements from html and change color, weight, size, and positioning of your elements. You can use it to modify inline elements, blocks, or entire classes all at the same time. Using css on your page is like using Microsoft word to type something instead of notepad.

      The html and css languages are huge and most of it is not necessary to remember, as long as you understand the basic principle. but if needing to find a specific tag or element they can always be found online from websites like <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3Schools</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>.

    <!--I also checked my code with the html and css checkers. I think I remember seeing something about how I can put their logo or something on my page saying it was checked but can't find that info on it anywhere and didnt want to just steal and use their logo incase of copyright issues or whatever. how would I do that? Or is it something that's even necissary?-->
